Abstract

<p>
The rapid growth of 3D printing technology has transformed a wide range
of industries, enabling the on-demand production of complex objects,
from aerospace components to medical devices. However, this technology
also introduces significant security challenges. Previous research
highlighted the security implications of G-Codes—commands used to
control the printing process. These studies assumed powerful attackers
and focused on manipulations of the printed models, leaving gaps in
understanding the full attack potential. In this study, we
systematically analyze security threats associated with 3D printing,
focusing specifically on vulnerabilities caused by G-Code commands. We
introduce attacks and attacker models that assume a less powerful
adversary than traditionally considered, broadening the scope of
potential security threats. Our findings show that even minimal access
to the 3D printer can result in significant security breaches, such as
unauthorized access to subsequent print jobs or persistent
misconfiguration of the printer. We identify 278 potentially malicious
G-Codes across the attack categories Information Disclosure, Denial of
Service, and Model Manipulation. Our evaluation demonstrates the
applicability of these attacks across various 3D printers and their
firmware. Our findings underscore the need for a better standardization
process of G-Codes and corresponding security best practices.

Abstract

<p>
3D printing is a well-established technology with rapidly increasing
usage scenarios both in the industry and consumer context. The growing
popularity of 3D printing has also attracted security researchers, who
have analyzed possibilities for weakening 3D models or stealing
intellectual property from 3D models. We extend these important aspects
and provide the first comprehensive security analysis of 3D printing
data formats. We performed our systematic study on the example of the 3D
Manufacturing Format (3MF), which offers a large variety of features
that could lead to critical attacks. Based on 3MF’s features, we
systematized three attack goals: Data Exfiltration, Denial of Service,
and UI Spoofing. We achieve these goals by exploiting the complexity of
3MF, which is based on the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) format and
uses XML to define 3D models. In total, our analysis led to 352 tests.
To create and run these tests automatically, we implemented an
open-source tool named 3MF Analyzer, which helped us evaluate 20
applications.

Abstract

<p>
The security of Industrial Control Systems is relevant both for reliable
production system operations and for high-quality throughput in terms of
manufactured products. Security measures are designed, operated and
maintained by different roles along product and production system
lifecycles. Defense-in-Depth as a paradigm builds upon the assumption
that breaches are unavoidable. The paper at hand provides an analysis of
roles, corresponding Human Factors and their relevance for data theft
and sabotage attacks. The resulting taxonomy is reflected by an example
related to Additive Manufacturing. The results assist in both designing
and redesigning Industrial Control System as part of an entire
production system so that Defense-in-Depth with regard to Human Factors
is built in by design.
